import Foundation

/// The predefined profiles shipped with CoreEQ — the classic Apple/Spotify
/// preset set, mapped onto the band ladder below. Selecting one replaces the
/// whole chain, so it clears any filters the user added by hand and "Flat"
/// means flat.
///
/// Most carry a shelf or two alongside the ladder, under one rule:
///
/// > **The ladder carries the preset. A filter only does what the ladder
/// > cannot: hold a shape past its ends, place energy between rungs, or use a
/// > bandwidth other than one octave. Strip every filter from a preset and the
/// > curve must still be recognisably that preset.**
///
/// The rule exists to keep the Graphic tab honest. If a preset's shape lived in
/// filters, its eleven sliders would sit flat under a curve that is anything
/// but, and dragging one would move the sound relative to a baseline the user
/// cannot see. Filters extend the sliders; they never replace them, and
/// `BuiltInProfilesTests` holds them to it.
///
/// What the ladder cannot do, measured rather than assumed:
///
/// - **Below its lowest rung it can only fall away.** A bell at 32 Hz is a bell:
///   Bass Booster reached +6.5 dB at 32 Hz and only +2.25 dB at 20 Hz — a third
///   of the advertised lift in the octave you feel.
/// - **Its top two rungs depend on the output device.** 16 kHz and 20 kHz sit
///   close enough to Nyquist that the sample rate reshapes them: Treble Booster
///   was +5.5 dB at 19 kHz on a 48 kHz device and +3.3 dB on a 44.1 kHz one.
/// - **Octave-spaced bells scallop between rungs.** Treble Booster sagged to
///   +3.2 dB at 12 kHz between its +6.7 dB neighbours, and no ladder gain can
///   fill a gap that lies between two sliders.
///
/// The ladder is the professional ISO octave graphic-EQ layout (32 Hz – 16 kHz)
/// extended with 20 kHz to cover the top of the audible range. Q of 1.41 gives
/// each band a one-octave bandwidth, matching the spacing. Every rung is a
/// bell, the ends included — `EQFilter.band(slot:gain:isEnabled:)` records what
/// happened when they were tried as shelves.
