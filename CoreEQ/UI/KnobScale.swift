/// How a knob's parameter maps onto its 270° sweep, and which values it is
/// allowed to land on.
///
/// Two separate questions, deliberately answered separately:
///
/// *The sweep* is logarithmic for frequency and Q, because both are heard that
/// way — 50 Hz to 100 Hz is the octave 5 kHz to 10 kHz is, and Q 0.5 to 1 is
/// the same halving of bandwidth as 2 to 4. On a linear sweep of 20 Hz–20 kHz
/// the whole bass register would be the first two degrees. Gain is linear,
/// matching the sliders and the dB scale beside the graph.
///
/// *The values* are an explicit ladder — every value the control may hold, in
/// order — and one detent is one rung. That is what makes scrolling up and back
/// down land exactly where it started. The obvious implementation, multiplying
/// by a fixed ratio and rounding the result to two decimals, does not: rounding
/// breaks the symmetry between multiplying and dividing, so Q 1.00 nudged up
/// and back came home as 0.99, and a frequency could come back 8% adrift. A
/// ladder cannot drift, because coming down means stepping back onto the rung
/// you left.
///
/// The rungs are spaced in a parameter's own terms — 1 Hz in the bass and
/// 100 Hz at the top — so the resolution is fine where the ear is and coarse
/// where it isn't, and every rung is a number worth showing.
///
/// A ladder only holds its promise for values standing *on* it. Q learned this
/// the hard way: with rungs every 0.05 above 1, the app's own default of 1.41
/// sat between two of them, so a band's very first nudge up and back down came
/// home as 1.40. So a parameter whose values do not all fall on a coarse ladder
/// gets a fine one — every value its field can display — and takes several
/// rungs per detent instead.
